# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data version 1.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The purpose of this project is to enable one's ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis.
Please submit a link to a Github repo with the code for performing your analysis. 
The code should have a file run_analysis.R in the main directory that can be run as long as the Samsung data is in your working directory. 
The output should be the tidy data set you submitted for part 1. 
You should include a README.md in the repo describing how the script works and the code book describing the variables.
